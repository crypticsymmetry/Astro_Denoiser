Astro Image Denoiser
Astro Image Denoiser is a sophisticated deep learning-based image denoising tool designed to enhance astronomical images. This repository contains the implementation of a denoising neural network that leverages various advanced techniques, including residual blocks, dense blocks, attention mechanisms, wavelet transforms, and transformers.

Features
Advanced Architecture: Combines residual, dense, and attention mechanisms with wavelet transforms and transformers for high-quality denoising.
Multi-Scale Feature Extraction: Captures both local and global features to effectively remove noise from astronomical images.
Efficient Upsampling: Uses pixel shuffle blocks for efficient and high-quality image reconstruction.

Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:

Residual and Dense Blocks: For robust feature learning.
Attention Mechanisms (CBAM and NonLocal): To focus on important features and capture long-range dependencies.
Wavelet Transform: For multi-scale feature extraction.
Swin Transformer Block: For capturing global context.
Pixel Shuffle Blocks: For efficient upsampling and high-resolution image reconstruction.
